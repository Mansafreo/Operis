## Notes on Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes called neurons, which process information and learn from experience.

### Key Concepts:

* **Neurons:** The basic building blocks of ANNs. They receive input from other neurons, process it, and generate an output.
* **Layers:** Neurons are organized into layers, with each layer performing a specific task.
* **Activation functions:** These functions determine the output of a neuron based on its input.
* **Learning algorithms:** These algorithms train ANNs by adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons.

### Applications of ANNs:

* Image recognition
* Natural language processing
* Speech recognition
* Fraud detection
* Medical diagnosis
* And many more
