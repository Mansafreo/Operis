## Recommendations
1. **Enhance Visibility of Key Functions**: Make the "Insert" and "Share" tabs more prominent, possibly through color coding or larger icons.
2. **Add Confirmation Prompts**: Implement a confirmation prompt when selecting file formats for saving.
3. **Provide In-App Guides**: Include step-by-step guides or tooltips for complex tasks such as sharing documents.

## Conclusion
The usability test revealed that while the Example Application is generally user-friendly, improvements can be made in navigation visibility and user guidance. Addressing these issues will enhance overall user satisfaction and efficiency.

**Next Steps**:
- Implement recommended changes.
- Conduct a follow-up usability test to evaluate the effectiveness of these changes.
